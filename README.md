# Enigma-Machine
Description: An Enigma Machine In a functional programming language. Created up with 3 parts; Encoding, Decoding and Code Breaking by using a process of elimination.

The Enigma Machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) is a cryptographic device used by the Germans during World War II to encode and decode secret messages. It employed a complex system of rotating wheels and electrical connections, making it a formidable challenge for Allied codebreakers, who eventually cracked its code with the help of early computers and brilliant mathematicians like Alan Turing.

No GUI is provided for this program, it was created to be imported into another Haskell program to solve problems in sequence.
